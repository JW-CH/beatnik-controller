**Last Updated:** August 1, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how Beatnik Controller ("we," "us," or "our") handles your information when you use our web application and mobile applications (the "App").

## Introduction

Your privacy is important to us. Beatnik Controller is designed to be a local remote control for your Snapcast server. Our policy is simple: we do not collect, store, or share any of your personal information. All data required for the app to function is stored locally on your device.

## Information We Collect

Beatnik Controller does **not** collect any personally identifiable information. The App handles the following data, which is stored exclusively on your device (e.g., in your browser's local storage or on your mobile device):

*   **Snapcast Server Address:** The hostname or IP address of your Snapcast server that you provide to connect the App to your server.
*   **Application Settings:** User-specific settings such as client names, group configurations, and other preferences you set within the App.

This information is necessary for the core functionality of the App and is never transmitted to us or any third party.

## How We Use Your Information

The data stored by the App is used solely to:

*   Establish and maintain a connection with your Snapcast server.
*   Remember your settings and preferences for a better user experience.
*   Allow the App to function as a remote control for your audio system.

## Data Storage and Security

All data entered into the App is stored locally on your device. We do not have access to this data. You are in full control of your information, and you can clear it at any time by clearing your browser's cache or the App's data on your mobile device.

## Third-Party Services

Beatnik Controller does not use any third-party services for analytics, advertising, or data collection.
